# Eklesia

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress. Use at your own risk :)
> üìù This README is temporary and subject to change.

Eklesia was originally conceived as a **TypeScript rewrite of [ChatArena](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/chatarena)** by the [Farama Foundation](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation), which defines multi-agent environments using Arena, Environment, Backend and Player abstractions. However, Eklesia already diverges by introducing an explicit **Orchestrator** layer, an architectural component that coordinates agents, environments, and interaction flows, making the system more modular and backend-agnostic.

---

## Origin & Differences

- **Origin**: Inspired by [ChatArena](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/chatarena) (Python, multi-agent language game framework) and rewritten in TypeScript.
- **Key architectural differences**:
  - Introduction of an explicit **Orchestrator** to manage interactions between agents and environments.
  - Backend-agnostic design (compatibility with Elysia, Next.js, Bun, etc.).
  - Extensible support for not just chat but also games and other interaction paradigms.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Easily manage multiple AI agents in the same environment.  
- **Simulated Environments**: Build or plug in different environments (chat, games, arenas‚Ä¶).  
- **Backend Agnostic**: Works with Elysia, Next.js, local setups, or any transport layer.  
- **Extensible**: Add new agents, environments, or interaction patterns effortlessly.

## Installation

```bash
bun install eklesia
```
